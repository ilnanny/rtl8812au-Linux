___      *Assuming you have already installed the build softwares, linux-headers or dkms;
            Follow the steps:
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

___      *Build / Install with Make

For building & installing the driver with 'make' use
      
      make
      make install
      


___      *DKMS

This driver can be installed using [DKMS]. This is a system which will automatically recompile and install a kernel module when a new kernel gets installed or updated. To make use of DKMS, install the `dkms` package, which on Debian (based) systems is done like this:
      
      sudo apt-get install dkms
      

___      *Installation of Driver

In order to install the driver open a terminal in the directory with the source code and execute the following command:
      
      sudo ./dkms-install.sh
      

___      *Removal of Driver

In order to remove the driver from your system open a terminal in the directory with the source code and execute the following command:
      
      sudo ./dkms-remove.sh
      


      
Package / Build dependencies (Devuan/Debian and derivates)
      
      apt-get install build-essential
      apt-get install bc
      apt-get install libelf-dev
      apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`
      
      
For Raspberry (RPI 2/3) you will need kernel sources
      
      wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notro/rpi-source/master/rpi-source" -O /usr/bin/rpi-source
      chmod 755 /usr/bin/rpi-source
      rpi-source 
      
Then you need to download and compile the driver on the RPI
      
      git clone https://github.com/ilnanny/rtl8812au-Linux.git
      cd rtl8812au-Linux
      make
      cp 8812au.ko /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/net/wireless
      depmod -a
      modprobe 88XXau
      
then run this step to change platform in Makefile, For RPI 2/3:
      
      sed -i 's/CONFIG_PLATFORM_I386_PC = y/CONFIG_PLATFORM_I386_PC = n/g' Makefile
      sed -i 's/CONFIG_PLATFORM_ARM_RPI = n/CONFIG_PLATFORM_ARM_RPI = y/g' Makefile
      
But for RPI 3 B+ you will need to run those below
which builds the ARM64 arch driver:
      
      sed -i 's/CONFIG_PLATFORM_I386_PC = y/CONFIG_PLATFORM_I386_PC = n/g' Makefile
      sed -i 's/CONFIG_PLATFORM_ARM64_RPI = n/CONFIG_PLATFORM_ARM64_RPI = y/g' Makefile
      


___      *Finish
